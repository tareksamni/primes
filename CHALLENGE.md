# Coding Challenge

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first N prime numbers.

The program must run from the command line and print a table to STDOUT.
The first row and column of the table should have the N primes, with each cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.
Allow the user to specify different table sizes through a command line option. If the option is not used, the table should contain the first 10 primes by default.
Notes:

Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
Do not use the Prime class from the Ruby stdlib (write your own code).
Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.
If youâ€™re using external dependencies, please specify those dependencies and how to install them.
Create a git repository containing the initial files and do regular and small commits to log your process.
Please package your code OR include running instructions.
